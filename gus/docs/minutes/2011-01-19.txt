[19:17] <@Sverk> peoples! lol
[19:17] <@Sverk> i logged into uidaho_cs383 & _cs384, lol
[19:17] <joran> wheres mike n sasha n chandler n etc
[19:17] <StephenF> Mikey's internet == lame. I'm not one to exaggerate, but there were literally a million people at Mikey's tonight.
[19:18] <joran> yeh we couldnt connect from mikeys
[19:18] <joran> me and stephen were there
[19:19] <NMazu> Ah
[19:20] <StephenF> So... do we proceed, or wait a while and see if folks congregate?
[19:21] <NMazu> Does anyone have anything particular that they're planning on bringing up?
[19:21] <@Sverk> i don't have anything
[19:22] <joran> I got a few
[19:22] <joran> not many
[19:22] <joran> 1. I am not sure people have django installed with mysqldb also
[19:23] <joran> 2. we should maybe have another meeting to get aptana installed
[19:23] <joran> b/c if you get it installed you have django setup right
[19:23] <joran> and its not that easy as stephen canattest to
[19:23] <StephenF> The IDE looks cool, but the setup was a pain in the butt!
[19:24] <NMazu> That sounds like a great idea to me
[19:24] <joran> its only cause django isnt  all set up
[19:24] <joran> if django was setup with mysql db most of those issues go away
[19:24] <joran> and we can be sure everyone has it installed properly
[19:24] <joran> if you dont use aptana thats fine
[19:24] <joran> but if we can get it setup that means django is setup
[19:24] <RevanTal> i tried to use the IDE, and i agree with the setup problems
[19:25] <joran> if it doesnt setup there are problems with your django install
[19:25] <StephenF> It would be good to get us all on common ground with dev environments, so we can start hammering out code...
[19:25] <RevanTal> i know i have django, because i was able to do the practice thing, but aptana was angery
[19:25] <joran> yeh prolly something about mysqldb
[19:25] <NMazu> So what day works out for people?
[19:25] <joran> which is the database connector
[19:26] <RevanTal> ah, yeah could be
[19:26] <joran> which means that you dont actually have django all setup ... basically django will fail with db
[19:26] <joran> Im fine with pretty much every meeting
[19:26] <joran> evening*
[19:26] <joran> lol
[19:26] <RevanTal> it seemed like the problem stemed from my initial missunderstanding with github though, and i havn't tried again since i figured that part out
[19:26] <joran> but i say soon
[19:26] <joran> i say in the next couple days
[19:27] <joran> friday isnt good for people im guessing
[19:27] <RevanTal> not particularly
[19:27] <joran> so tomorrow night or monday is my reccomendation
[19:27] <@Sverk> nor thursday for jacob & I
[19:27] <RevanTal> yeah
[19:27] <joran> probably monday so people have enough time
[19:27] <joran> but i know nathan isnt abig fan of mondays
[19:27] <NMazu> If we make it at 5ish I should be able to do okay
[19:28] <joran> 5 works for me
[19:28] <RevanTal> works for me
[19:28] <RevanTal> wait
[19:28] <RevanTal> oh
[19:28] <RevanTal> :(
[19:28] <@Sverk> 5's good
[19:28] <joran> lol

[19:28] <joran> does that work?

[19:29] <RevanTal> tuesday will work
[19:29] <joran> I dont have class tomorrow
[19:29] <RevanTal> but it gets to be kind of late for this time arround
[19:29] <joran> next thursday i have lab until 10am

[19:29] <StephenF> I'm available any time after 4:30 during the week
[19:29] <RevanTal> dang

[19:29] <RevanTal> sure
[19:29] <NMazu> Tuesday's a little far out for my tastes, but if that's all that works.
[19:29] <NMazu> That's fine
[19:29] <@Sverk> k
[19:30] <joran> ok what tiems work for people tomorrow?

[19:31] <@Sverk> on thursdays
[19:31] <joran> I agree the sooner everyone has same dev environment the sooner they can really start coding
[19:31] <NMazu> I'm up with that, as long as everyone can get to one or the other
[19:31] <joran> if not i can meet up privately if its just one or two ppl
[19:32] <RevanTal> sounds good
[19:32] <RevanTal> what time tomorrow are people meeting?
[19:32] <joran> but theyll have to take the initiative to get in contact with me ... ill popst that im available
[19:32] <joran> but its up to them to follow up
[19:33] <NMazu> What's the time tomorrow?
[19:33] <joran> im free all day
[19:33] <NMazu> 3:30?
[19:34] <joran> hows this 1 on 1 might be best anyway ... my GF lives above mingles so im always there
[19:34] <joran> howbout you call me
[19:34] <joran> and ill show up at sisters
[19:34] <joran> as long as u give 15 mins notice
[19:34] <joran> all day today and tues
[19:34] <joran> err tomorrow
[19:35] <joran> but we can say 3:30 for group but just call me whenever if you want
[19:35] <joran> just bring your computer
[19:35] <joran> (hopefully the one you plan to develope on)
[19:36] <RevanTal> heh
[19:36] <joran> and i know how do do it on win pretty easy
[19:36] <RevanTal> i'll just bring my laptop
[19:36] <joran> but other installs may take some time
[19:36] <NMazu> I'll plan on 3:30 then, either with group or individually
[19:36] <joran> which ever
[19:36] <joran> call first though
[19:36] <joran> even if 3:30
[19:37] <NMazu> kk
[19:37] <joran> unless that will be problematic then just email and reconfirm your time but calls are preffered
[19:37] <joran> for this
[19:37] <joran> if you email prolly leave at least an hour lag time if not more
[19:38] <NMazu> Will do. I may do both :)
[19:38] <NMazu> But if only one, it will be a call
[19:38] <joran> stephen u get the mysqldb installed on your home setup (or it maybe already
[19:39] <StephenF> it's not, but I'll give it a shot :)
[19:39] <joran> and i can remote trouble shoot any aptana issues with teamviewer
[19:39] <joran> i can hellp get it installed probably
[19:39] <joran> just was hard without inets there
[19:39] <RevanTal> oh, good idea teamviewer
[19:39] <joran> yeh its good
[19:40] <joran> not quite as good as one on one
[19:40] <joran> but close second
[19:40] <RevanTal> that way you can help on my desktop using my laptop!
[19:40] <joran> hehe yeh :)
[19:40] <joran> just write down your access info
[19:40] <RevanTal> well, i can be there, but i dev on my desktop cuz of the quad core thing
[19:40] <joran> before you go
[19:40] <RevanTal> i have it emailed to myeslf
[19:40] <joran> lets do remote installs if its  gonna be desktop
[19:40] <RevanTal> i use teamviewer regularly
[19:41] <@Sverk> lol we can do same between my netbook and main laptop since carrying it around is a pain
[19:41] <joran> still just as soon have you there and do it largely in person
[19:41] <joran> but we can get into your home with teamviewer
[19:41] <RevanTal> indeed
[19:41] <joran> and setit up there
[19:41] <joran> otherwise i just end up doing it and if it breaks later your hosed
[19:41] <joran> and i have to do it again :P
[19:42] <joran> (which might happen anyway and is fine .. but still)
[19:42] <joran> oh max btw
[19:42] <@Sverk> Â¿
[19:42] <joran> dont put id fields most of the time
[19:42] <joran> django automagically does that
[19:42] <joran> and then reference with ForeignKey instead of ints
[19:42] <@Sverk> k, just was guess based off other's code
[19:42] <joran> and it does db joins
[19:42] <@Sverk> guessing*
[19:42] <joran> and pulls related data
[19:43] <joran> so we dont have to do as many queries ... its cool :)
[19:43] <joran> no harm done at all just figured id mention it before you coded alot around that model
[19:43] <joran> and had to throw out alot or basically reinvent django's associations
[19:44] <joran> but if you do ForiegnKey(gus_group)
[19:44] <joran> thats the same as groupid =intField()
[19:44] <@Sverk> k
[19:44] <joran> except in the case with foriegn key we get all the group info also
[19:45] <joran> as opposed to just its id
[19:45] <joran> (but sometimes that might be desired... but not generally i think)
[19:45] <@Sverk> there, made a sticky note of all that, lol
[19:45] <joran> hehe
[19:46] <joran> not critisizing ... just a headsup so u dont do alot more work than necessary
[19:46] <joran> and i need to lrn2spell
[19:46] <@Sverk> lol
[19:46] <joran> so good meeting guys
[19:47] <joran> see you guys tomorrow and friday and monday and tues ... man seeing lots of you guys
[19:47] <joran> lol
[19:47] <NMazu> lol
[19:47] <NMazu> Good evening, all
[19:47] <@Sverk> lol, cya
