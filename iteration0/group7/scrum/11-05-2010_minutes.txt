<mike_s> so. since last time, we turned it in. that went well, i think. before next scrum, we should all pick a use case to write a unit test for, and add it to a list on a shared google doc
<RevanTal> do we want to just list out what use cases there are now, and then post that in a google doc, just add names next to what you are going to work on?
<mike_s> okay. lets do it
<Sverk> that sounds good to me
<mike_s> i'll share one
<mike_s> link posted to group
<mike_s> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GOTA_y8WHjAE1xEdlF2wUwAd3nF2acDGQhBnXqBiNAk/edit?hl=en
<RevanTal> so we've got:
<RevanTal> add user, remove user, add group, associate group and user
<RevanTal> we came up with 5 in class right?  i can't remember the others...
<mike_s> what else do we need
<Sverk> delete group?
<mike_s> display group members?
<RevanTal> but at least we've got enough use cases for 1 each
<Sverk> that'd be a good one
<mike_s> good. done. everyone pick one. free for all style
<mike_s> okay. all scrummed out? just add your test case with a useful name to the python file so it will be easy to merge
<mike_s> we could just post it all on a google doc
<RevanTal> that is by monday? or tuseday, or what?
<RevanTal> we could even post it on that google doc
<mike_s> sure, it doesn't matter. i guess before next scrum or next class, if you need the time
<Sverk> k
<mike_s> alright done. it's dinner time. any issues to google docs, i suppose.
<mike_s> haha good to know.  adios!
<RevanTal> bye!
