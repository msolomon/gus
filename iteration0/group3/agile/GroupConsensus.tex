\title{Agile Methods -- Group 3 Decision}
\date{October 27, 2010}
\author{Mike Solomon, Jacob Flynn, Max Stillwell}
\maketitle

Our group has reached a consensus on our preferred development method.  We would like to use Extreme Programming due to its incorporation of many good ideas, especially for teams of approximately twelve.  However, we would like to use aspects of Feature-Driven Development to dole out labor and design.  In addition, we would like to use Test-Driven Development to do all of the actual coding (with possible exceptions when tests are difficult to write, e.g.\ GUI testing and database testing) due to the input of professionals in the industry and the practical experience it would provide.


Our group would also like to veto Scrum.  We feel that the stringent requirements it imposes are impractical for our setting.  For example, it would be impossible for our entire team to meet daily, or for us to hold an eight-hour planning meeting.  We believe that we would have to mangle the definition of Scrum to the point where we would neither gain practical experience with the method nor benefit from following the monster we would surely create.  In the interest of learning practical skills while profiting from the use of an agile method, Scrum should not be our method of choice.
