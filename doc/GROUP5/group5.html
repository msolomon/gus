<p>I spoke with the director of the University of Idaho Honor's Program, Stephan Flores.
<br>At the moment, the UHP uses a combination of free software and mailing lists to communicate and manage its members.  The UHP has a <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> set up for managing events and uses <a href="http://www.doodle.com">Doodle</a> to RSVP and manage participation for some of those events.  One feature that the UHP expressed interest in is being able to check for scheduling conflicts between events before finalizing the time and date for a new event on the calendar.  Most of the communication and file sharing done by the UHP is done through e-mail and mailing lists.  At the beginning of each semester, they receive a list of students and e-mails for members of the UHP and they put all of those into a mailing list.  There are also mailing lists for faculty members, graduate students, and undergrads split up by department.  Because of how these mailing lists are set up and handled, receiving duplicate e-mails happens semi-often.  Gus may be able to avoid that problem.
<p>Overall, the UHP expressed interest in gus and the idea of combining all of the features they use into one package.
