Didn't go well
we do not like c++
need a new language (php)
	-good interfacing tools
	-yay for sql
	-windows
		-wamp (appache / mysql...)

we do not like cve
	- doesn't work easily
	- why use something else when we have git and skype
	- doesn't take php

===================================================
Things that did go well
diagraming
classes / use cases

===================================================
Plans for next scrum
-see actual (visual) representation of work (not just code)
-get php running on all machines
-get a mysql server an all machines
-continue populating use case lists
-get database wrappers done
-write good test cases
-functions
	add / delete groups
	add / delete user
	link groups / users (lists?)
	database functions
