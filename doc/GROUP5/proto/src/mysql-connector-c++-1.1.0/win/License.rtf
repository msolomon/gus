Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\par
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\par
Preamble\par
========\par
\par
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\par
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\par
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\par
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\par
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\par
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\par
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\par
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\par
your programs, too.\par
\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\par
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\par
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\par
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\par
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\par
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\par
\par
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\par
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These\par
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\par
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\par
\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\par
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\par
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\par
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
\par
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\par
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\par
distribute and/or modify the software.\par
\par
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\par
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\par
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\par
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\par
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\par
authors' reputations.\par
\par
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\par
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\par
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\par
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\par
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\par
\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\par
modification follow.\par
\par
                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\par
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\par
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\par
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\par
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",\par
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on\par
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under\par
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a\par
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\par
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\par
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each\par
     licensee is addressed as "you".\par
\par
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\par
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act\par
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the\par
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on\par
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the\par
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\par
\par
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\par
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\par
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\par
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\par
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\par
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of\par
     this License along with the Program.\par
\par
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\par
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange\par
     for a fee.\par
\par
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\par
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\par
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\par
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par
\par
       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\par
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\par
\par
       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that\par
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program\par
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge\par
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.\par
\par
       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\par
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\par
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display\par
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and\par
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you\par
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the\par
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to\par
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program\par
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\par
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required\par
          to print an announcement.)\par
\par
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\par
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\par
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate\par
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not\par
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\par
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\par
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of\par
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\par
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each\par
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.\par
\par
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\par
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the\par
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\par
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.\par
\par
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the\par
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on\par
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\par
     other work under the scope of this License.\par
\par
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\par
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\par
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\par
     following:\par
\par
       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\par
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\par
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\par
          software interchange; or,\par
\par
       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\par
          years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your\par
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\par
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\par
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\par
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\par
\par
       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\par
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\par
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\par
          received the program in object code or executable form with\par
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\par
\par
     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\par
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete\par
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\par
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\par
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.\par
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\par
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\par
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\par
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable\par
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\par
\par
     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\par
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\par
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\par
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\par
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\par
\par
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\par
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\par
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\par
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\par
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,\par
     from you under this License will not have their licenses\par
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\par
\par
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\par
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify\par
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions\par
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.\par
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work\par
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this\par
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\par
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\par
\par
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\par
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\par
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program\par
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any\par
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\par
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance\par
     by third parties to this License.\par
\par
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\par
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent\par
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\par
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this\par
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\par
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\par
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\par
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\par
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit\par
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\par
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only\par
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain\par
     entirely from distribution of the Program.\par
\par
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\par
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is\par
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\par
     in other circumstances.\par
\par
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\par
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of\par
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\par
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\par
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\par
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\par
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\par
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is\par
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a\par
     licensee cannot impose that choice.\par
\par
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed\par
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\par
\par
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\par
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\par
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this\par
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\par
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\par
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this\par
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\par
     this License.\par
\par
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\par
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such\par
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but\par
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
\par
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\par
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies\par
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following\par
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\par
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program\par
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose\par
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
\par
 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\par
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\par
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted\par
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software\par
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision\par
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\par
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\par
     and reuse of software generally.\par
\par
                                NO WARRANTY\par
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\par
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\par
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\par
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT\par
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\par
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\par
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\par
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\par
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\par
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\par
\par
 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\par
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\par
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE\par
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\par
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\par
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\par
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\par
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY\par
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\par
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\par
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
=============================================\par
\par
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\par
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\par
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\par
terms.\par
\par
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\par
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\par
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\par
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\par
     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.\par
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR\par
\par
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\par
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\par
     (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\par
     GNU General Public License for more details.\par
\par
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\par
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\par
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.\par
\par
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
\par
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\par
when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\par
     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR\par
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\par
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\par
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\par
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show\par
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your\par
program.\par
\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\par
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\par
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\par
\par
     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\par
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\par
\par
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989\par
     Ty Coon, President of Vice\par
\par
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\par
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,\par
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\par
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the\par
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\par
