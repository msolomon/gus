<b>Admin/Staff</b> - This is the person or people in who have the maximum level of access over the group. This includes all activities of Officers and below, as well as more sensitive work, such as control of Officers and control of the group password.
<p>
<b>Officer</b> - This is basically a weaker admin in a group who is delogated to keep things running smoothly. Officers have all functionality of normal users, but can also do other group-based tasks, such as organize the calendar and add or remove new users.
<p>
<b>User</b> - Exactly as the name implies. Users can only do the most basic tasks in a group in terms of group management, but still maintain control of their personal information and what groups they personally belong to. 
<p>
<b>Group</b> - Consists of a multitude of users and other groups in a large tree-like structure. They are mostly controlled through the Officers or Admins and have almost no personal functionality at this stage of development. At the moment, they also only have a Calendar, but may gain additional functionality like forums in the future.
<p>
<b>Calendar</b> - A basic calendar to organize group events. They are controlled by the Officers and Admins of a group. This may be outsourced to a third party application in development, as long as it maintains desired functionality.
<p>
<b>Event</b> - A calendar event that consists of a date, description, and duration. Members of a group can sign up for these.

After repeated attempts to speak directly to leaders of a religious group on campus were unsuccessful, the data for this was instead gathered from various students in a religious community around campus. The general consensus was that most of Gus's formal club based features, such as fee management and billing were of no priority, but a way to manage the community, such as the calendar, would be very useful.
