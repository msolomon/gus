Requirements that I found from the ACM: The ACM's major requirement is in
regards to book keeping. Being able to have a mechanism to keep track of
members information such as a user list. More specifically there will need to be able
to add different entries to this rather than being constrained to a certain
set of values. Likely entries include, but should not be limited to: Name,
Email address, Membership status, and UserID.
<p>

I pulled information from my own experience as an ACM officer (VP) as well as from fellow and past officers .

Background information regarding TALuS: <br>
The name stands for "Trio Alumni Society".  It is a group of 
first-generation graduates from low-income families.
<p> 
Requirements that I found from TALuS: <br>
Their major requirement is the need for urgent messages to be sent effectively. They currently communicate 
through text messages and Facebook, and the VP (Teara Lyons) noted that having text message notifications 
and possibly automated Facebook notifications would be extremelyhelpful. 
<p>

My information came from an interview with Teara Lyons, the VP of TALuS.
