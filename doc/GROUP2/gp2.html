could either be one user list or multiple for any sub-groups.

emails to the group.

adding or removing a user from a group's user list

Officer: Special type of group owner that can view any private data from the
user list along with anything that a group owner and User to do.

Requirements that I found from the ACM: The ACM's major requirement is in
regards to book keeping. Being able to have a mechanism to keep track of
members information such as a user list. More specifically there will need to be able
to add different entries to this rather than being constrained to a certain
set of values. Likely entries include, but should not be limited to: Name,
Email address, Membership status, and UserID.


I pulled information from my own experience as an ACM officer (VP) as well as from fellow and past officers .
