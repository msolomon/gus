Status: Stuck on compile
While trying to compile source, I get the make error:

Think we found X11, you are good to go.
think we don't have OpenGL, skipping CVE build

With the X windowing system, the GLX libraries are required (extensions for X) 
to communicate with OpenGL. Both are installed, but the libraries for either
are apparently not searchable in the path, even though they were globally 
installed. I will either resolve this and have more information, or try my 
Macbook Pro with OSX 10.5, and have some more information soon.
