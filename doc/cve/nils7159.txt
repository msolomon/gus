When installing, directory defaulted to C:\Program Files\ rather than J:\Program Files\ like it should have.

Attempted to run from the option in the installer and received an error:

Unable to execute file:
J:\Program Files\CVE\bin\cve.exe

CreateProcess failed; code 740.
The requested operation requires elevation.


Attempted to run again and it worked.  Cannot remember my password.  Program closes when I try to change my password and fail to get it right; no error so maybe this is a feature?  It's annoying regardless.

Made a new account (I think) and was told that the server is down.  I don't actually know if I was successful in making a new account or not.
