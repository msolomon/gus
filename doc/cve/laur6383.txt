CVE report

After a single failure when I first tired to install and run CVE I was 
able to get it working without issue on my winXP machine.  I created and 
account, logged in and walked around a bit.

The second time I logged in again and walked around some more, openned 
some doors and snooped in the virtual offices of professors.  Then I 
created a c++ project and attempted to load and compile a very old 
assignment from and early class.  CVE then crashed and I called it good.

I love the concept and kind of wish our project was in a langauge that 
CVE supported so I would need to get better with it, maybe even help 
improve it.  I also very much like the idea of "quests" that teach.  I 
recall video games growing up that involved learned rather than just 
mindless violence.
