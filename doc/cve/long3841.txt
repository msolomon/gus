CVE report
12/6/2010

My experience with CVE was mostly good.  I like the fact that 
you can use the virtual world to interact and collaborate with
other people on software projects.  Being able to chat with 
team members while writing code, and easily working on code 
together in real time is something that can boost productivity 
big time.  As Hani and Jafar pointed out, there are still some 
improvements needed with chat, but it is already functional and 
effective as it is.  When writing code, I like how CVE numbers 
each line as you go.  Another thing I like about CVE is how it 
lists your projects, groups, etc. neatly on the side of the 
screen for quick access.  One thing I don't like is the fact 
that it is too easy to accidently log out (like when I select 
the make option from the menu and it says press any key to 
continue).
