I have tried numerous CVE builds, however none of them seemed workable. In my experience, I have had verious points of failure. The first point at which I gave up was when I was unable to log in after making an account. I found the error given at this point to be rather useless, as it wouldn't stay on the screen for long enough to read. This should be taken into consideration, because if an error is necessessary, you shouldn't have to take a screen shot in order to read what it said. My next attempt at using CVE involved the avatar builder. I couldn't get the picture to upload and be right-side up. At this point, I ended up loging in with a default avitar. In the visual interface, I had problems walking around and adjusting the camera. I have never been able to try a collaborative coding experience because there has never been anyone online to try it with. All in all, I did not believe it to be very useful to the coding experience in its present state.
