[20:01] <joran> hey guys
[20:01] <Sverk> hello
[20:02] <@ldv629> hey
[20:02] <joran> are we waiting to see if some more folks showup?
[20:02] <Sverk> looks like
[20:02] <@ldv629> yeah give them a few more
[20:03] <joran> ok afk a few thn
[20:08] <joran> well lets get goin meh ... we'll see them tomorrow
[20:09] <joran> everyone havin fun w python?
[20:09] <Sverk> haven't had time to mess with it much
[20:09] <@ldv629> bit by bit
[20:09] <joran> did u guys see my proposal on using a prebuilt cms as a platform?
[20:10] <joran> any comments on that? better solutions?
[20:10] <joran> (not for implementing by thurs)
[20:10] <joran> but after break
[20:10] <@ldv629> I haven't looked at it yet
[20:10] <Sverk> i glanced at it but havn't read through it
[20:11] <joran> i just said theres prebuilt cms ' we should think about using one
[20:11] <joran> it has nice css
[20:11] <joran> makes creating "module" like blocks that can be enabled in the backend easy
[20:11] <joran> and has built in support for event calendar/agenda
[20:11] <joran> and some built in support for dynamically created pages
[20:12] <joran> and theres prolly a bunch of cons
[20:12] <joran> but im a pretty positive guy :P
[20:12] <Sverk> lol
[20:12] <joran> So i would assume were safe on our docs till thurs
[20:13] <RevanTal> positive is really the best way to be
[20:13] <joran> theres no way he's gonna look at them early
[20:13] <@ldv629> should be
[20:13] <joran> as long as theyre in the repository in some form
[20:13] <RevanTal> no, but he might refuse to pull after tomorrow
[20:13] <Sverk> hopefully, as i've had no one send me edits or additions
[20:13] <@ldv629> I'll probably have mine done just incase
[20:13] <RevanTal> mine are basically done, as long as everyone thinks they are good
[20:16] <joran> they looked  ok from the list
[20:16] <joran> but where are the actual usecase writeups?
[20:16] <joran> or u just grabbed the old ones?
[20:16] <RevanTal> http://groups.google.com/group/uidaho-software-engineering-10-11/files
[20:16] <joran> lol oh yeh
[20:18] <joran> i got scared off by the 7z originally :P
[20:18] <joran> but im good lookin now
[20:18] <Sverk> lol
[20:19] <RevanTal> heh yeah, i was kinda worried about that
[20:19] <joran> that should have read "but im good,  looking now"
[20:20] <joran> meh yeh all looks fine to me
[20:20] <joran> i dunno reading use cases is about as fun as dental surgury w/o the laughing gas
[20:21] <joran> but yeh they look good
[20:21] <RevanTal> shiny
[20:22] <joran> have you guys messed / python/django enough to judge how comfortable you are w/ the language?
[20:22] <joran> personally im likin it more and more as i find out all the cool stuff built in to it
[20:23] <joran> (prolly moreso features of  django , rather than the features of pythong
[20:23] <Sverk> haven't had much time to really do that either, i do like python from what i've messed with so far
[20:24] <@ldv629> I'm in about the same spot with liking what I have seen, just haven't done as much as I want
[20:25] <RevanTal> pretty much yeah
[20:25] <RevanTal> just wish there was more time in the day
[20:25] <joran> yeh well go in and mess w/ my forum code / or login stuff or whatever ... or just play off line with your own installs of django
[20:25] <joran> yeh i hear that
[20:26] <joran> ok well are we done?
[20:26] <Sverk> i have nothing more
[20:26] <RevanTal> i don't have anything else to add
[20:26] <@ldv629> i'm done
[20:26] <joran> ill take my turn at cut n paste minute taker i guess
[20:26] <joran> ok so long guys
[20:26] <Sverk> k, cya then
[20:26] <joran> go team!
