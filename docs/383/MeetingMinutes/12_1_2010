[20:01] <joran> yo
[20:01] <@Sverk> hello
[20:01] == NMazu [816513b5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.129.101.19.181] has 
joined #uidaho_cs383
[20:07] <joran> whats the plan tonight?
[20:08] <NMazu> I don't really have anything of importance to talk 
about; gonna get the statechart finished up and gitted tonight for 
feedback
[20:09] <StephenF> Actually, Max and I are ready for some feedback from 
the unified class diagram, soon as I get it in the repo (still haven't 
talked to L. Hughes, I'm lazy)
[20:09] <ldv629> yeah I should have mine up in the next couple of days
[20:10] <ldv629> I've been working on a big term paper
[20:10] <@Sverk> i'll upload it to google
[20:10] <StephenF> Thanks :)
[20:11] <StephenF> There were a few questions raised about the webpage 
class, and how it fits in to the big picture, but I think we should get 
some general input first and see if it looks strange to anyone else 
before hashing it out more
[20:11] <joran> everyone get all those links i sent out?
[20:11] <joran> and instructions to setup the shell?
[20:12] <ldv629> got the links just haven't done it yet
[20:12] <joran> The webpage class i think is just a collection of blocks 
mostly
[20:12] <joran> or rather pages prolly
[20:12] <ldv629> that's kinda tomorrow and friday's project for me
[20:13] <joran> and then each page would be made up of wigets or 
something ... at least thats kinda how i see it
[20:13] <StephenF> Right, so the groups have a collection of pages, 
which are in turn a collection of widgets, right?
[20:13] <@Sverk> 
https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3u2OkezWtOhMWFmNjZjZmEtMDM5MS00MDIxLTg0Y2YtMWI0YmY3MGNhZDNl&sort=name&layout=list&num=50
[20:13] <StephenF> Also, I got Apache+Python+Django on one of my boxes 
finally... no more built in Django server for me ;)
[20:14] <joran> lol thats what you think :P
[20:14] <joran> yeah thats how i see it at least
[20:14] <joran> naw the server is funny
[20:15] <ldv629> I get that google doc as not being available when I 
click your link
[20:15] <@Sverk> :(
[20:15] <NMazu> Same here
[20:15] <joran> everything in the root folder has to be prefixed by gus 
namespace
[20:15] <joran> like INSTALLED_APPS = {"","gus.myapp"}
[20:15] <joran> and in urls.py also
[20:16] <joran> which is weird so if you get busted when u upload thats 
probably why
[20:17] <@Sverk> not sure why, its public to all with a link
[20:17] <StephenF> So one thing I'd like to do tonight is maybe assign 
some of the sections to people to start working on? My section of the 
talk next Thursday is going to be too darn small, so I need to achieve 
something before then :) Say... the image gallery widget perhaps?
[20:17] <joran> sure
[20:17] <joran> if you think you can manage to make some noticible 
progress or finish it by thurs
[20:18] <StephenF> I won't finish it, but it'll give me something to 
talk about at least. Other than "Hey, my dev environment is up!" :P

[20:18] <@Sverk> how bout that
[20:18] <StephenF> I can see it now
[20:18] <@Sverk> k
[20:19] <joran> that looks nice and clean
[20:19] <ldv629> that looks good
[20:20] <RevanTal> back
[20:21] <StephenF> Are there any other things we need to merge? It'd be 
nice to have one source of documentation somewhere in the repo
[20:21] <joran> we could say something like modules are complete pages 
or sets of pages (like forums) that in turn can be made up of many 
widgets (blocks like calendar, feed, etC)
[20:21] <RevanTal> i'm going to be working on the merge of the use cases 
tomorrow afternoon
[20:22] <StephenF> Cool beans. Anything else out there, or is that it?
[20:22] <@Sverk> i also have this: 
https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3u2OkezWtOhYWM3YzM5N2YtYzRhNy00NjE5LTkzYzctZjk2YzdjNGJlMTFi&sort=name&layout=list&num=50    
but i'm assuming the link is dead?
[20:22] <@Sverk> been repairing the origional ssrs
[20:22] <ldv629> yes that is dead
[20:22] <RevanTal> yeah, link is not working
[20:23] <@Sverk> curse you google
[20:25] <ldv629> is there anything else of importance as wednesday is my 
busy night
[20:25] <RevanTal> i dont' think so
[20:25] <@Sverk> i can't figure out why the link doesn't work so i'm 
done
[20:25] <RevanTal> will have to have a longer meeting sometime between 
now and thursday next week to fully plan out the presentation
