#summary Information about the profiling branch

= Introduction =

This page describes the *profiling* branch for _django-logging_. This introduces
additional functionality to make use of the Python's
[http://docs.python.org/lib/profile.html profiling capabilities].

= Installation =

The branch can be checked out from:

{{{
svn co http://django-logging.googlecode.com/svn/branches/profiling/djangologging/ djangologging
}}}

The basic installation instructions are the same as those on the [Overview]
page. The new `LOGGING_PROFILER` setting must also be provided to enable
profiling:

|| *Variable*         || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| `LOGGING_PROFILER` || `None`    || To enable profiling, set this to a supported profiler. Currently this can be either `hotshot` or `cProfile`. ||

= Todo =

  * Store the profile data in a FIFO queue so that only data from the last _n_ requests is kept.
  * Make the graph thumbnail draggable for fast panning.
  * Allow sorting, grouping, etc. on the raw statistics.
  * Add `trans` and `blocktrans` tags to the new templates. 

= Feedback =

This branch is effectively a beta pre-release, so I'm keen to get feedback and
ideas for what it should do. If you spot any bugs or want to make a suggestion,
please use the
[http://code.google.com/p/django-logging/issues/list issue tracker], or
[http://www.nevett.org/contact contact me directly].

Thanks,
